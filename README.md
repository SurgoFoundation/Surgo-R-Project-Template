# Surgo project template

This is the default structure for Surgo projects in R. It follows the [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/index.html) structure.

The philosophy is that anyone at Surgo can come in and quickly understand what is happening in any of our projects - what are the datafiles, what preprocessing happens, what analysis scripts are there.
